# Military Gear Catalog

A web-based **product catalog** for a real-world store selling second-hand military uniforms and gear originating from various European armies.

This catalog is built using Python and Django, serving as an online showcase for customers to browse available products, view prices, and find contact information for ordering or visiting the store.

#### 💡 Purpose

This project was created for a physical store that specializes in used military products.
This is **not an online shop**, but rather a structured and searchable product catalog.

Customers can:

- Browse items with descriptions, price ranges, and photos
- View detailed information and photos of the products
- Filter product list by category or country of origin
- Search for products within a category or across the catalog
- Create a personal account and add products to a wishlist
- Get store contact info to order by phone or visit in person

#### ⚙️ Features

- Product catalog with categories and filtering
- Individual product pages with descriptions and photo galleries
- Admin interface for catalog management (CRUD)
- Desktop-first layout with Bootstrap 4
- Image gallery with thumbnails and iframe-based preview
- Clean URL structure using Django class-based views
